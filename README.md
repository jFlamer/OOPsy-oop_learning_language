## Goals 
Creating an educational programming language aimed at helping young learners grasp object-oriented programming in an intuitive and accessible way, along with a compiler that translates the code into Python.

## Implementation language
Python was chosen for its readability, simplicity, and widespread use in education. Python also offers robust support for building interpreters and compilers, including libraries for lexical and syntax analysis.

## Scanner & Parser implementation
The scanner and parser will be implemented using ANTLR 4, a powerful parser generator that supports multiple target languages, including Python.
ANTLR will be used to define the grammar of the language, from which it will automatically generate the lexer (scanner) and parser components. These components will then be integrated into the Python-based compiler.
